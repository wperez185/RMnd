    <p class="about-p margin-left">RMnd holds a growing database of millions of company reviews, CEO approval ratings, salary reports, interview reviews and questions, benefits reviews, office photos and more. Unlike other jobs sites, all of this information is entirely shared by those who know a company best — the employees. Add to that millions of the latest jobs — no other site allows you to see which employers are hiring, what it's really like to work or interview there according to employees, and how much you could earn. RMnd is also available via its mobile app on iOS and Android platforms.</p>
    <p class="about-p margin-left">For employers, RMnd offers effective recruiting and employer branding solutions via RMnd for Employers. We help thousands of clients and partners promote their employer brand to candidates researching them and advertise their jobs to ideal candidates who may not be aware of them. What differentiates RMnd from other recruiting channels is the quality of job candidates we deliver and our influence on candidates' decisions as they research jobs and companies.</p>
